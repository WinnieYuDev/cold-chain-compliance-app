The only import\nyou can use is the built-in \"convex:/_system/repl/wrappers.js\" module in the\ntemplate.\n\nThe function call is also completely sandboxed, so it can only read data and\ncannot modify the database or access the network.\n\nReturns the result and any log lines generated by the query.",
